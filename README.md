> The Freemarker template engine used inside a simple rendering framework

This example shows the TemplateResult class, an easy interface to the Freemarker functionalities which abstracts and automates much of the work needed to use this template engine as the view layer of a web application.

## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://webengineering-univaq.github.io). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 18th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

This is a Maven-based project. Simply download the code and open it in any Maven-enabled IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse. 

*Please do not download the code from the main branch, but from the branch corresponding to the platform used in the lectures:**
- the **JEE** branch contains the application version to be run on the **JavaEE 8** platform inside **Apache Tomcat version 9**. 
- the **JKEE** branch contains the application version to be run on the **JakartaEE 10** platform inside **Apache Tomcat version 10**. 

Note that you may need to *configure the deploy settings* based on the chosen platform/server: refer to your IDE help files to perform this step. For example, in Apache Netbeans, you must enter these settings in Project properties > Run.
